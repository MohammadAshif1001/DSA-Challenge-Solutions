## 🌟 The Alphabetic Alchemy

Behold the art of transforming letters into magic! 🧙‍♂️

🌟 **Convert to Char Arrays:** Begin by converting both input strings `s` and `t` into character arrays `arr1` and `arr2`.

🌟 **Sort the Char Arrays:** Sort the character arrays using the enchanting Arrays.sort method. This aligns the letters in a harmonious sequence for comparison.

🌟 **Check Anagram Equality:** Utilize the Arrays.equals method to compare the sorted arrays. If they are identical, a spellbinding anagram has been discovered!

**Time Complexity Spell ⏳:** The dominant factor in the time complexity is the sorting step, which takes O(n log n) time complexity for each array. Since there are two arrays, the overall time complexity is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input strings.

**Space Complexity Chant 🔮:** The space complexity is proportional to the lengths of the input strings, making it O(n), where n is the length of the longer input string.

## 🔮 Unleash the Spell

Let's summon the magic of code to detect anagrams with precision!

🌟 **Spell of Code Incantation 🪄:**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        char arr1[] = s.toCharArray();
        char arr2[] = t.toCharArray();

        Arrays.sort(arr1);
        Arrays.sort(arr2);

        return Arrays.equals(arr1, arr2);
    }
}
