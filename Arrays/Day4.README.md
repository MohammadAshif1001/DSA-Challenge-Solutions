## 🌌 Problem Description

Get ready to employ your coding prowess to solve this intriguing puzzle! You are tasked with determining whether an array contains duplicate elements. Your magical code should return true if any duplicate value is found, and false if all elements are distinct.

## 🔮 The Magical Approach

Behold, the ingenious algorithmic approach! 🧙‍♂️

🌟 Sort the Array: Start by sorting the given integer array `nums`. Sorting groups identical elements together, enabling easy detection of duplicates by comparing adjacent elements.

🌟 Check for Duplicates: Traverse through the sorted array using a loop. For each element at index `i`, compare it with the next element at index `i+1`. If `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[i+1]`, it indicates the presence of duplicate elements.

🌟 Return Result: If any duplicates are found during the iteration, your code should return true, indicating the presence of duplicate elements. If no duplicates are found after examining all adjacent pairs, the function should return false.

**Time Complexity Spell ⏳:** The dominant factor in the time complexity of this approach is the sorting step, which has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The loop for checking duplicates runs in linear time, O(n), after the sorting is complete. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array.

**Space Complexity Chant 🔮:** The space complexity of the solution is determined by the sorting algorithm. If a comparison-based sorting algorithm like the one used by `Arrays.sort()` is used, the space complexity is O(1) as it doesn't require any additional memory proportional to the input size. However, if a sorting algorithm with space complexity proportional to the input size is used, the space complexity could be higher.
